Yes, I'm okay. LA has a lot of variety, especially health-oriented stuff and all kinds of food. You can go to the desert or anywhere, really. The weather is great, though lately it's been unpredictable. The traffic can be frustrating, and sometimes there's a bit of rudeness, but not too much. It's nice to get a change of scenery and experience things I wouldn't normally do, meeting different people and learning about their customs. It depends on the location, but if there's pretty water, I love being in it, relaxing and seeking adventure. I went to the Cayman Islands once, and even though I get seasick, my sister gave me medication so I could snorkel. I accidentally got on the wrong boat, and they made me jump back into the water and swim to the right one. I thought I was going to drown because the water was rough, but I survived! I studied business management, but I'm also into hypnotherapy. I grew up in a serious family, so business felt like a universal choice that covered many subjects. Looking back, I kind of wish I had studied something different, like liberal arts or communication, because I love speaking, interviewing strangers, and I’m very outgoing and funny. My dream job would be traveling, exploring different places, and getting paid for it, always on some fun adventure, interacting with people, trying new things, and helping others. I enjoy watching TV, working out, walking, and I recently fixed up a bike. I like going to festivals, grocery shopping, and interacting with friends or strangers. As for conflict, I'm good at handling most situations, though traffic and rude people can be tougher. Sometimes, if someone is really rude, I confront them, like once in a parking lot. I remember arguing with my sister, not sure about the topic, but she always thinks she's right because she's older. It can be frustrating, but I often let her rattle on because it’s not productive. I'm close to my family, seeing my parents almost every weekend, especially my mother. I stay in touch with my twin sister who lives out of town, as well as my other two sisters. We all have a bit of assertiveness, maybe even some aggressiveness. Strangers have been unexpectedly kind to me, like helping me reach something in a store or commiserating with me if someone’s been mean. Years ago, I had a neighbor who was nasty to me because he thought I didn’t like his dog, which caused a lot of stress, and I wish I had confronted him sooner. As for regrets, there are many, like breakups or ending friendships. I feel guilty about past behavior, not being understanding, and when I was younger, I even stole things. If I could erase anything, it would be how tough my dad was and memories of bad relationships. I tend to fall asleep easily but can get cranky, irritated, and snarky, especially when anxious about money or relationships. When stressed, I take deep breaths, eat healthier, work out, or talk to friends. Though I haven’t been officially diagnosed, I know I experience anxiety, especially in confrontational situations or when someone invades my personal space. I was depressed over ten years ago, stuck in negative thoughts, feeling hopeless and helpless. I occasionally see a hypnotherapist, which has helped release anxiety and increased my self-awareness, confidence, and willingness to try new things. I feel proud of helping people, whether it’s handing out water at a marathon or making people laugh at my sister’s event. People describe me as loyal, empathetic, supportive, outgoing, and quirky. I’d love to look or feel younger, be more patient with people, and not get frustrated when I think someone isn't smart. My advice to others would be to plan for the future, be kind and patient, have fun, and try new things. I’m proud of my perseverance, how I’ve changed my personality, and the volunteer work I’ve done to help people lose weight, declutter their homes, and create positive change. It was nice talking to you!

Prototype 2:
I'm good. I was born in Mexico City about thirty-four years ago. Although I try to return once a year, I haven’t been back in three years due to time constraints. While I’ve traveled to other places, I’m planning to go back to Mexico next year. I can’t see myself moving back to Mexico City; it’s just too huge, and I prefer Los Angeles for its opportunities and the sense of home it gives me. My family moved to California when I was very young, and I’ve grown to love traveling, even though I haven’t done as much as I would like. Traveling allows me to see new places and meet people from different cultures, which is incredibly enriching. My last trip was a seven-day cruise that took me to St. Thomas, Barbados, St. Lucia, and St. Martin. It was an amazing experience, and I would love to do that trip again. I also had the opportunity to visit the pyramids at Teotihuacan during my last trip to Mexico. It had been many years since I last visited, and it was breathtaking to see those incredible structures up close.In social situations, I consider myself more on the shy side, often feeling uncomfortable when starting conversations. I tend to wait for others to approach me, and I sometimes feel out of place at parties. My interest in history has been a significant part of my life; I studied it because I wanted to learn about various cultures, particularly U.S. history. Currently, I work in education, but my dream job would be to travel the world and have a show on the Travel Channel. It would be amazing to get paid to do something I genuinely enjoy. When it comes to relaxation, I love reading and taking baths. I find that soaking in a bath while reading is one of the best ways to unwind. Additionally, I enjoy going to the gym, which helps me manage stress, even though I didn’t always handle my emotions well as a child. I sometimes struggled with anger management, and while I’ve improved over the years, I still find myself getting angry more easily than I’d like. Recently, I had an argument with my best friend, where she accused me of thinking I was better than her because I went to school and she stayed home with her kids. I wish I had handled that situation differently; I started off calm, trying to reason with her, but the conversation escalated into a yelling match. In retrospect, I could have let her express her feelings and suggested discussing it later when we were both calmer. One of the hardest decisions I’ve had to make was breaking up with a boyfriend after seven years. Even though I knew it was the right thing to do, I felt like I was wasting those years. Ultimately, it was the best decision for me, as it led me to meet my husband. I also had a frightening experience years ago when I was at a party. A guy I didn’t know tried to pull me into a room and choke me. Thankfully, one of my friends heard me scream and came to my rescue. It was a terrifying moment, and I still think about it often. I have a good relationship with my siblings; my sister is two years younger, and my brother is two years older. We get along well, and I think my sister and I are closer now than ever. My parents and I also have a solid relationship, although my dad sometimes treats me like a little kid, which can be annoying. I usually wake up several times throughout the night, making it rare for me to sleep through the entire night. I often feel tired in the morning because I’m definitely not a morning person. Falling asleep can be difficult, and I sometimes have bad dreams or need to get up to use the restroom. I don’t remember the last time I actually slept the whole night without waking up at least once. Emotionally, I’m feeling good because I’m currently on vacation from work. Although I haven’t been to the gym in a while, which makes me feel a bit bad, I’m generally in good health. Recently, my husband and I went to Santa Barbara for a weekend getaway, where we enjoyed wine tasting and relaxing at the beach. I believe my friends would describe me as a caring and patient person, though they would probably also say I’m very shy and have a hard time saying no when asked for favors. I often find myself doing things for others, which can be overwhelming at times. I wish I were more outgoing so I could make more friends, as I don’t have a large social circle because of my shyness. Additionally, I wish I had more patience; sometimes I can be short on it, which can lead to frustration. Reflecting on my life, I regret that it took me a long time after high school to return to school and get my degree. I wish I could have addressed my education sooner. I also regret spending seven years with my ex-boyfriend and wish I had focused more on my studies rather than socializing and partying. I would tell my younger self to prioritize education and understand that hanging out wasn’t as important as I thought. One of my proudest achievements is graduating from UCLA after many years away from school. That accomplishment means a lot to me, considering the challenges I faced along the way.

Prototype 3:
I'm good, yes. I moved to Iowa in 2001. I prefer it there for holidays and special family events. It's much better. I attended UCLA for three years in their screenwriting program. It was difficult due to the stress of managing everyday living. There’s a lot of variety here, which I like, though the traffic can be an issue. I haven’t traveled internationally; I just haven’t had a reason to. I have a BS in math and physics. I went to school later in life because I wanted to learn something substantial. Writing fiction is extremely difficult. If I had worked as hard in school as I do now, I would have a PhD in math and physics. Being outgoing depends on the circumstance; it varies with the moment. To relax, I swim. The last time I swam was last Friday. When I’m annoyed, I tend to swear to myself. It takes a lot to express my anger, but I was annoyed recently while waiting in traffic. I don't really feel guilty; instead, I feel remorseful about past actions or words, particularly in interpersonal interactions with friends or family. Sometimes, out of the blue, I recall things I wish I hadn’t said or done. I generally feel in control of my emotions and know when to respond to situations. There’s nothing recent that I wish I had done differently. In the past, I’ve had to swallow my pride and admit I was wrong to friends. I’ve had past altercations with my mom, saying things that hurt her. Hurting those closest to you sticks with you. My emotional intelligence has grown since then. I have a good relationship with my mother and both my sisters, but my relationship with my father has been difficult. He has advanced Alzheimer's, which complicates things. My sisters have been a positive influence in my life. I sleep well, usually eight to ten hours each night. Sometimes, I feel lethargic and just go through the motions. David Lynch said that the idea of the angst-driven artist is nonsense. He believes that to be creative, you should get a good night's sleep. I like starting my day well and am always thinking about how to be more productive. I haven't been diagnosed with any psychological conditions. This weekend, I had a great time with friends; we talked for two to three hours about various topics. I enjoy discussions with informed, open-minded people. It feels like the high you get after exercising. I wish I were taller and didn't wear glasses. I have no internal issues; I’m patient and have been commended for it. I understand that relationships take time and energy, and I invest in them. I regret not being more productive or efficient with my time daily. I hate wasting time, money, or energy. If I could advise my younger self, I would say to get some help with co-dependency issues.

Prototype 4:
I'm doing fine here in California, in Los Angeles. I love being near the beach, living in a big city, and having lots of friends and family around. However, the traffic can be overwhelming, and sometimes there are just too many people. Generally, I'm happy here. I studied photography and language studies because I've always been interested in photography, and I wanted to learn the languages of my ethnic background. It wasn't hard; it was a passion. My dream is to do photography full-time and to pursue some creative projects, like creating a line of women's robes. I've traveled quite a bit and love experiencing different cultures and meeting new people. I lived in Greece for over a year, where I taught English, and I had a fantastic time exploring different parts of the country with friends. Initially, I can be shy, but I become much more outgoing as I get to know people. To relax, I often stay at home, watch a movie, or just rest in bed. Recently, I had a minor argument with my boyfriend regarding money issues, which has been stressful as I'm struggling in my career right now. I feel guilty about not generating enough income and am actively looking for ways to improve my financial situation. I’ve also been feeling stressed, but I usually manage to sleep well at night. Occasionally, I wake up feeling grumpy and lethargic. One of the hardest decisions I've made was deciding not to continue a pregnancy due to financial burdens and the father's lack of interest in having a child. This was a very difficult choice for me. However, I’ve experienced moments of happiness, like during a holiday in Cancun over the New Year when I felt carefree and relaxed. I wish I could be more assertive in life, but I consider myself a loyal and caring friend. My relationship with my family, particularly my father, isn't great. My parents divorced when I was young, and he's been mostly absent from my life. While this situation isn't painful anymore, it could be better. My stepchildren are wonderful, but navigating that relationship can be challenging. I strive to avoid the kind of discipline I experienced as a child and focus on creating a supportive environment for them. I’m proud of the fact that I’ve traveled the world, lived in many places, and learned several languages while maintaining long-lasting friendships. Thank you. Goodbye.

Prototype 5:
Yes, I'm doing pretty good. I'm from Oklahoma, specifically Oklahoma City. The weather here is great; I love being near the ocean, the palm trees, and the mountains. It was pretty easy adjusting to California, but the size of the city and the traffic have definitely been an adjustment. I always wanted to live in California because I hated being landlocked in Oklahoma and wanted to be near the ocean. I studied psychology and minored in art. No, I’m not working on my degree anymore, but I just got hired to work at a group home for teenage boys who’ve been in trouble with the law. My dream job? I don't really know, but I just want to help people. I think working in psychology might already be my dream job. To relax, I like to read, watch movies, go to the beach to watch the sunset, or hang out with friends. What makes me really mad is injustice—people being mistreated or abused, and especially being lied to, including myself. When I'm annoyed, I try to count to ten, take deep breaths, and avoid reacting negatively. I think I control my temper well most of the time, but like most people, I sometimes lash out at the ones I’m closest to. The last time I argued with someone was probably with my parents. I've been having car trouble and running low on money, and we likely argued about how I need to be more independent and take care of things like my car. I’m very close to my family, even though they’re still in Oklahoma, and we talk all the time. My mom is probably the person I’m closest to, and she’s a wonderful role model—hardworking and unselfish. One of my most memorable experiences was bungee jumping over the Nile River in Uganda. It was such an adrenaline rush, and I still have flashbacks of the freefall—it was amazing! I’ve traveled a lot in the past, including working for Norwegian Cruise Line, which allowed me to see different places and meet all kinds of people. I also did an 11-month mission trip around the world, helping out in different third-world countries. Traveling really opens your eyes to the diversity of people and places, and it’s cool to see how different the world is. No, I haven’t served in the military. I’ve never been formally diagnosed with depression, but I’m pretty sure I’ve struggled with it off and on. Lately, I’ve been sleeping well, but in the past, insomnia was a big issue for me. When I don’t sleep well, I’m not a pleasant person to be around. Sleep is really important for me to function. Recently, I’ve been feeling a lot better. After being unemployed for several months, I just got a job offer last week, which lifted a lot of the weight off my shoulders. Before that, I was really down, feeling like a hermit in a new city where I didn’t know many people. But now, with a job offer, I feel much more confident and positive. The last time I felt really happy was a couple of days ago when I explored a new part of the South Bay area. It was foggy at first, but when the fog lifted, I saw beautiful scenery I hadn’t seen before, and I just felt so lucky to live here. My best friend would probably describe me as daring, bold, fearless, unique, artistic, and a non-conformist. I tend to question everything, which can be both good and bad. I’m proud that I live my life with no regrets. I try to live an exciting life, and I’ve traveled and moved to different places on my own. I like that I’m independent and don’t let fear hold me back. There’s nothing major I regret because I’ve learned from everything, whether it was good or bad. If I could give advice to my younger self, I’d tell myself to keep dreaming big and not let anyone stop me from believing that anything is possible. I’d tell myself never to give up and to believe that I can achieve whatever I want. Recently, I went home to Oklahoma for Christmas and got to see some college friends I hadn’t seen in years. It was really fun to catch up, go out to dinner, and have a great night together. Cool, you’re welcome. Bye!
