Prototype 1:
Hi. Yes, today is a wonderful day, and I am doing absolutely marvelous. I was born in Cleveland, Ohio, and raised in Tucson, Arizona. I moved to Los Angeles when I was sixteen years old. I’ve only been back to Cleveland once since leaving. It’s quite different now, a whole new community. Growing up in Cleveland gave me a great sense of community, which I feel is missing in Los Angeles. My grandmother passed away and left property for my father to manage, so we relocated here. Since I was young and naturally good at meeting new people, it wasn’t hard for me to adjust. Moving has never been difficult for me because I love traveling and experiencing new places. Meeting new people always felt like an adventure. One of my fondest memories comes from 1964 when I went to visit my grandmother in Cleveland. While I was there, I had the chance to visit an Indian reservation. Later, I wrote to them because I had to give a school speech about my summer experiences. They sent me a Kachina Indian doll, which would be worth around a quarter of a million dollars today if I still had it. I can be outgoing and sociable when necessary, though I also have a shy side. In college, I initially pursued Computer Science but later switched to Business Administration with a concentration in Marketing and Advertising. I missed interacting with people, which drew me to marketing. Now, I work as a celebrity photographer. While I love my job, establishing relationships and securing well-paying work is still an ongoing process. Recently, I’ve reconnected with meditation. I meditate twice a day, and it really helps to calm my body and mind. I usually keep my temper in check, though like anyone, I sometimes lose my cool. Just the other day, my daughter and I had an argument over something I said that hurt her feelings. I didn’t mean to, and it upset me to see her hurt. We work closely together since she is a makeup artist and I am a photographer. This can cause some friction, but I’m incredibly proud of raising her and her sister. Being a parent is never easy, but my daughters are my greatest accomplishments. One of the most difficult moments in my life was a night that changed everything for me, but I prefer not to go into detail about it. Another tough decision I faced was how my husband and I ended our marriage. Looking back, we both could have handled things differently and better. Another critical decision in my life came when I had a stroke while traveling for work. I was on a plane when I suddenly lost sensation on one side of my body. A doctor on the flight told me not to board my connecting flight, and I chose to go to the hospital instead. That decision probably saved my life. I survived the stroke, which the doctors told me was rare, but I’ve been left with nerve damage in my hand and face. Despite this, I’m incredibly grateful to still be alive and able to continue my photography career. I’ve also struggled with depression, which stemmed from injuries I sustained while I was a teacher. I was hit on the head multiple times and knocked unconscious, leading to sleep apnea and serious trouble with sleeping. Therapy would help, but I can’t afford it since I don’t have medical insurance. Navigating the disability system after my stroke has also been very challenging. Despite all the difficulties, I wake up every day feeling grateful. Just being alive and able to continue doing what I love, like photography, brings me happiness. I don’t dwell on regrets; the past is behind me, and I focus on the present moment. My advice to myself is to keep moving forward, no matter what. I’m especially proud of discovering my creative side as a visual artist, even though I started later in life. Photography has been a therapeutic outlet for me, and I’m so thankful for the creative talents I’ve been able to nurture.

Prototype 2:
I moved to Santiago, Chile, permanently in 1977. About every three to four years, my parents moved here very easily. I appreciate the variety, culture, and many options available. However, traffic can be a challenge, and there's pressure to live up to high standards, which can be expensive. I got a job in the social service field without an education, and I felt that with an education, I would be better equipped to provide services for the population I was working with. My goal is to own a nonprofit organization that provides services for women from marginalized populations. I like to travel, but I don't travel a lot. I enjoy experiencing different cultures, architectures, and cuisines. One of my favorite places is Sedona, Arizona, because it's beautiful, clean, and open. I can be shy, but I force myself to be more outgoing, even though people perceive me as very outgoing. In my free time, I check Facebook, read emails, or watch movies. Sometimes I manage well, but there are times when I feel stressed and have temper outbursts. About thirty days ago, I struggled with feelings of shame, anger, and confusion regarding my parenting skills. I have four kids: three boys and one girl. My oldest son lives in Mar Vista and is doing a menial job. He's creative, artistic, and has a good heart. My second son lives in Alabama, has a daughter, and also works a menial job. He moved there to be with his daughter, and he is funny, smart, and clever. My youngest son lives in Los Angeles, working at a menial job while finding himself. He is extremely kind, sensitive, and caring but can be hard on himself and has many opinions about various topics. I love being a parent, but it's not easy. The unconditional love I feel for my children includes tolerating their shortcomings and suffering, leading to regret for not doing a better job. I tell my children that I love them and that I'm proud of them. I maintain open communication and am more accepting of their choices, even when I disagree. I'm close to my sisters but distant from my mother. I was close to my father when he was alive, but he passed away when I was twenty-five. My college professors helped me see a different perspective on human beings, making me more altruistic, open, and less judgmental. I believe I could have made better choices regarding the fathers of my children. When I left my first marriage, I was immature and unknowledgeable. I felt I couldn't provide for my children, so I chose to leave them with their father for a time, which I regret. When I was thirty-six, I was diagnosed with cancer and had to leave my children with their fathers until I recovered. Separation from my kids has been hard, causing feelings of shame, guilt, and remorse. I wish I had a more stable financial and emotional foundation to avoid causing them some of their current problems. Sometimes I feel tired and ineffective, but I am making a more conscientious effort to get organized and focus on my physical health and well-being. Originally, I think I was diagnosed in 1980, but it was never formal. I once tried to commit suicide, but I am no longer truly suicidal. I went to the beach for a walk with my dog. I have a great ability to empathize and am open to learning. I crave knowledge and have strong social empathy. I love my children and consider myself a good friend. However, my depression is one thing I struggle with. I wish I were more intelligent and that school had been easier for me. I also wish I didn't have low self-esteem and could be more motivated to participate in areas that interest me, like going to college.

Prototype 3:
Yes, I’m doing fine. I’m originally from Indiana, but I moved to LA about ten years ago because I don’t like the cold weather—LA has great weather, the ocean, and lots to do. One of my favorite memories was spending a day on the Catalina Islands for my birthday. I’ve had a lot of changes in my life, like leaving Indiana for good, which felt huge at the time. I’ve been pursuing a career in filmmaking, something I haven’t done yet but really want to, although I can be shy and have trouble trusting people because of my past. When I’m stressed, I watch TV or go to the movies, and I don’t really argue or lose my temper. I try to avoid stress and push people away, which I regret because it makes it hard to form connections. I don’t have a close relationship with my family; we don’t talk much, and I often feel isolated. Sometimes I struggle to sleep, and racing thoughts or stress keep me up, but I try to manage it with music and relaxation. I’ve been feeling down lately, wishing my life had turned out differently, especially when it comes to having friends or a real relationship. I find comfort in playing online games with avatars where people don’t know who I am. My ideal weekend is playing games, going to the movies, or driving somewhere new to explore. If I could go back in time, I’d tell myself to keep a journal and make different choices. I regret how my life turned out and wish I had more stability, but I’m proud of being self-taught and consider myself a genius at figuring things out. Thanks for listening, and have a good day.

Prototype 4:
I’m okay. I’m from Connecticut, but I moved to Los Angeles to be an actor. I moved to San Francisco in 1994 and then to Atlanta in 1996, and I became a realtor instead. My dream is to be on a TV show. It’s pretty hard to get discovered; you have to be lucky and know the right people.I don’t travel that much anymore. I used to move every couple of years, but now I’ve been here for a while. The weather is great; there’s always something to do. However, people here can be a little rude, and it’s always fast-paced. I was 25 when I moved here, and it was a lot of fun back then. I did well in real estate, but after the market crashed, times have been tough.I’m much more of an extrovert. I get annoyed with rude and inconsiderate people. I usually control my temper, especially when I’m not drinking alcohol; that makes it worse. The last argument I had was with someone who owed me money.I live alone with my dog in West Hollywood. I don’t like my neighbors; they argue with me about noise from my hardwood floors, even though I’ve been living here for ten years.My mother has been a very positive influence on me. We were close, but she recently moved to Rhode Island to live with my brother. I’m not as close with him, but we love each other.I’m outgoing, the life of the party, and ambitious, but sometimes cut-throat. I’m proud of my ability to get through challenges and my generosity, loyalty, and friendliness.About four years ago, I was beaten up and experienced identity theft, which made me afraid to go out. After spending a year at home, feeling depressed, I decided I had to start talking to people again. Right now, I’m panicking about my job situation because my bills are high, and I don’t have a steady income.I recently quit drinking altogether, which is positive because I didn’t like how I acted when I drank. I was using it to numb myself, but now I have to deal with my feelings, which is good for personal growth.I’ve taken various medications, but I stopped recently to get my body back to a normal state. I worry a lot about everything: accidents, financial issues, and opportunities I missed. I’ve had both good and bad therapists, but I prefer those who engage with me rather than just prescribe medication.I don’t currently attend therapy, but I find talking to someone can be beneficial. I don’t have a problem sleeping unless I don’t sleep well, which makes me irritable.My best friend would describe me as friendly, outgoing, and a little secretive. I’m definitely friendly and outgoing, but I wish I were more accomplished and happier. I’m very open; I have a perfectionist streak that can be dangerous.I’m a good hairdresser and makeup artist, and I enjoy various crafts. I used to keep a perfect house and was a perfect wife, but I'm divorced now. My ex-husband had problems with drugs, which made things difficult.I have regrets but believe that you should accept your decisions and move forward. I wish I had asked my ex-husband about his drug use before marrying him.I enjoy simple pleasures, like having my Starbucks or eating well. I feel good when I have something to do and a goal to achieve. When I help others or make them laugh, it puts me in a good mood.A memorable experience was getting a new dog when I was a kid after my previous dog was killed. I’ve treated people poorly in the past when I was hurting, but since I stopped drinking, I’ve been kinder.I’ve learned that drinking was not the solution to my problems. I want a stable career, like being a doctor or working in advertising. When I have a job, I feel happy and productive. Thank you!

Prototype 5:
I’m okay, just a little tired. I’m from Los Angeles originally but moved to Pasadena when I was eighteen. I like the weather here and the diversity; my girlfriend is from Taiwan, so I enjoy experiencing different cultures. However, I don’t like the traffic and the crazy people; it can be hard to get things accomplished. When I first arrived, it took me about six months to figure out the directions.I haven't been back to my hometown in about eight to ten years. I don't have a good relationship with my brothers, so I prefer not to hang out with them. I recently returned from a trip to Orlando with my girlfriend, who loves to travel. Meeting new people and seeing new places helps me gain a different perspective. I attended the Avatar seminar, which focused on raising consciousness and clearing mental clutter. I feel better after that experience. As a psychic, I've been dealing with psychic attacks, which can be challenging. I believe there’s more to life than what we see, as many things exist in other dimensions. I’m both introverted and extroverted; I enjoy spending time alone, but I also like meeting new people. I watch movies, read, do crosswords, and sing. I’m currently writing a novel inspired by a dream, and I’m expanding the first twenty pages into something more substantial. I get mad when people don't respect me, especially my brothers. I want to love my family but don’t want to be around them, which creates a conflict. I manage my temper well; I only get angry about once a year. Recently, I had a minor disagreement with my girlfriend over something trivial. The last time I felt really happy was hanging out with friends. My best friend would describe me as an open book, compassionate, and strong in my identity, but she also teases me for lacking awareness of social norms. I haven't been officially diagnosed with PTSD, but I experienced a traumatic event that left me with symptoms. Sometimes, I panic over triggers related to that experience. My dad is currently sick, which adds stress to my life, and I’ve been having bad dreams connected to that. I’m generally easygoing, though I can feel irritable and tired at times. I focus on being positive and have been working on reducing stress through exercises. I often judge myself too harshly, but I’m learning to have less judgment and more fun in my life. I recently attended a seminar that helped me take a break from my stressful job and life. I would describe myself as outgoing, fun, and smart, though I sometimes find that people in L.A. are distant and not interested in spending time with others. I spend a lot of my time worrying and criticizing myself instead of moving forward. I’ve been trying to avoid these negative thoughts by watching TV or going to the movies, but it doesn’t always solve the problem. Financially, I’m struggling to pay my bills, which feels like a self-defeating cycle. My girlfriend has been really helpful; she’s funny and cares about me. I consider myself intelligent, creative, and a good listener. I’ve written about four or five books, and my singing voice has improved significantly over time.
